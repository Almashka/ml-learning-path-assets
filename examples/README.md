# Example notebooks

The example notebooks include output (we clear the output in `/notebooks` for better version control and a clean start).

In some cases, the output cannot be rendered by the default github viewer. It may provide a glyph that looks like a circle with a dash in it. This glyph provides a tooltip with a link to the external nbviewer.

To go directly to the nbviewer -- where you can see interactive charts -- build a URL like this:
